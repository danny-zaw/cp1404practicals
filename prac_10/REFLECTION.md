# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

For smaller tasks, they were usually accurate. At most, it would be 5-10 minutes off. 
However, I did underestimate (by a lot) the time I would take to complete bigger tasks, 
such as the project management program in Prac 7, which has more complexities and challenges
than normal tasks. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy remained consistent for smaller programs. However, for larger programs, 
I was able to provide more realistic estimates as I progressed through the later practicals.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Making these estimates taught me the importance of time management, enabling me to set 
realistic timeframes for completing a program based on the complexity of the task.
It also helped me focus on completing the program within the timeframe I set for myself, 
rather than getting distracted other things.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learned that receiving feedback through code reviews is a valuable way to enhance 
my work. There were several aspects I overlooked, but others quickly picked up on them. 
It has shown me the importance of considering different perspectives and how they can lead
to improvements that I might have missed.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Doing code reviews also helped me improve my own code. By noticing small issues in others' 
code, I was reminded to avoid making the same mistakes in my own work.


### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 5 Code Review for Primadeb](https://github.com/Primadeb/cp1404practicals/pull/2#pullrequestreview-2380528578)

### Explanation


In this code review, I provided a balance of positive and constructive feedback. 
I acknowledged the areas where the code was strong while also pointing out areas for
improvement. My comments were written as suggestions, using phrases like "I think this 
could be improved by..." or "This dictionary could be renamed to...".

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 9 Code Review for NicoleTanQR]()

### Explanation

This person's code was well-written, making it challenging to find areas for improvement. 
Therefore, I focused on acknowledging the strong aspects of the code. One point I mentioned
in the review was that the test code should include assertions or comparisons between 
expected and actual results to ensure the correctness of the code.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

- Writing code on paper should be part of the submission requirements.
- For Practicals with bigger tasks, such as Prac 7's Project Management Program, due 
  dates should be extended as they require more time than normal. 
- Writing assert tests could benefit from additional explanations or a 
  dedicated lecture video.
- Implementing a system to encourage practice or extension work, such as offering 
  bonus points toward the final practical score.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

- For the most part, I believe I followed the instructions fairly well. 
- I rarely looked at the solutions, well, except for when I get stuck. 
- I learned from Lindsay's in-person feedback and applied it to future practicals, improving my work over time.
