# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

If I find myself stuck while doing practicals, I re-watch the lecture videos. I am also visiting
the programming patterns on GitHub more frequently than before.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I'd like to work more efficiently and reduce time spent on tasks, 
though I know this is part of the learning journey.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Starting and finishing tasks early has reduced last-minute stress 
and given me time to refine my work. Revisiting my code daily with a fresh perspective 
has helped me catch any problematic areas that could be improved.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Contrary to my practicals and assignments, I tend to leave lectures until the night before the seminar, 
and I often find myself getting sleepy by the time I reach the last video. 
I need to watch them earlier in the week.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

This subject along with Programming I are well-designed and I find them the most enjoyable
out of all the IT subjects so far. I hope the other subjects could provide the same engaging experience.
